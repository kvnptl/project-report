    \textbf{Utilization of 4D Imaging Radar in Adverse Weather}: There is a notable lack of research utilizing 4D imaging radar sensors, especially in adverse weather conditions \cite{Zhou2022May}. Given the potential of these sensors in challenging environments, further exploration in this area is essential. The K-Radar dataset \cite{Paek2022Jun} is a step in the right direction, but yet to be explored.

    % TODO: write more on this
    % All these are not yet well explored and very little research is being done on them.
    - BEV fusion exploration with 360 view
    - Use of dense radar sensor, use 4D radar
    - Explore pointcloud and image fusion
    - Improvement in Radar projection by using Frustum-based approach
    -Advance perception tasks such as semantic segmentation and object tracking in adverse weather conditions
    -Apply temporal fusion which also aggregates radar sparse points to get denser points
