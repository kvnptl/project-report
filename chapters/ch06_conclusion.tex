    \textbf{Utilization of 4D Imaging Radar in Adverse Weather}: There is a notable lack of research utilizing 4D imaging radar sensors, especially in adverse weather conditions \cite{Zhou2022May}. Given the potential of these sensors in challenging environments, further exploration in this area is essential. The K-Radar dataset \cite{Paek2022Jun} is a step in the right direction, but yet to be explored.
